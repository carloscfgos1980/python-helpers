Exercise: Async/await
Use the documentation from TheMoveDB and use the code you have made in the previous assignment as a starting point. In the current exercise, you will learn to properly read API documentation and how to make multiple kinds of requests, namely a Post and Delete as well.

Set-up:

You need an API Key. Read the documentation and see the previous assignment.

You can use the code from the previous exercise to get started.

A few points of attention:

* You are going to make simple lists in HTML with a number of movie categories.
* Create separate functions for retrieving your data. For example: getMovieGenres(), getTopRatedMovies(), getTopRatedActionMovies(). Consider whether these functions should be synchronous or asynchronous.
* Also in the function's name, you always put the REST method (GET PUT POST DELETE). For example: If I wanted to post a rating of a movie to TheMovieDB, I would make the function postMovieRating() for it.

Part 1: GET different endpoints

1. Make a list of all available genres and their corresponding IDs in the TheMovieDB 

Expected result:
Movie genres listing

*** Ver image (I & II)**** 

2. Get 1 movie, based on the movie ID with Postman (so not the genre ID) â‡’ (how can you find out the ID?). Use the /find endpoint and read it well.

Did you manage to grab 1 movie with Postman? Then get the next movies with Postman, 1 by 1:
The Lion King (2019)
The Joker (2019)
Toy Story 4 (2019)
You have now learned how to retrieve 1 specific movie. Finally, add 1 <h1> to your HTML and use this to show the title of your all-time favorite movie.

3. Make a new list of 10 Top Rated Movies

* You can choose the context yourself: all-time (default), of the month (extra params?), or 2019 (extra params?).
* Expected result:

*** VEr image***

Movie genres listing v2

4. Create a new list of the best movies (top rated) within the genre action. Use the Discover query.

5. Create a new list with movies from the year 1975

Use the Discover query

Part 2: Post request (only with Postman)

You are going to make a POST request, which will post your rating to a movie of your choice.
Note: "A valid session or guest session ID is required. You can read more about how this works" (so read the documentation carefully)
Your rating actually appears in the database, and can be returned trace to your API key and therefore your email address. So you want to send something "real".
Check the code generation function in the documentation. They don't use the fetch() method, but you can get some inspiration from it on how the settings should be.
Check if it was successful. Check your rating at https://www.themoviedb.org. Or maybe you can make a GET request of the movie's ratings, to see if yours is among them? Can be both.
Part 3: Delete request (only with Postman)
Delete your rating above.
Also for this one applies that there is a "valid session or guest session ID is required." Read the documentation on how to delete a DELETE request from your rating.
