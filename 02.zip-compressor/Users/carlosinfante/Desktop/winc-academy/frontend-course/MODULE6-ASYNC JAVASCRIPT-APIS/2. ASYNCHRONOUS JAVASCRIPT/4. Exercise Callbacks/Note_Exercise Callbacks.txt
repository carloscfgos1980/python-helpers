Exercise: Callbacks
Step 1

Create a function and name it makeHomework , this function takes two arguments. You can name the first argument course and the second argument callback.

â‡’ In fact you can call your arguments whatever you want, but for a callback (which is a function) it is often also named callback to avoid confusion.

The makeHomework function outputs a console.log that reads: "Okay, ok, I'm going to do my [insert course here] homework now".

Tip: use ${string interpolation} to insert the course argument in the console.log text. To use string interpolation, use backticks (`) instead of normal quotation marks (").

Right below the console.log the callback function is called without arguments.

Step 2

Under the now complete function of makeHomework, create a separate function that you call doneWithHomework. It does not accept arguments.
The doneWithHomework function runs a console.log that says "Look, Mom/Dad, I'm done with my homework!".
Step 3

Under both functions you can now call the Make homework function with two arguments. The first takes the string "math", the second argument is the function doneWithHomework.
Step 4

Use SetTimeOut() in your makeHomework function.
